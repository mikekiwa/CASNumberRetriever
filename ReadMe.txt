### Instructions to Run the Script

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved `cas_retriever.py` and `requirements.txt`.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     
bash
     python -m venv venv
     
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       
bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       
     - On macOS/Linux:
       
bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required packages:
     
bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **If a new release of pip is available**:
   - Install update:

bash
     python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     
bash
     python CASRetrieverWithProgressBar.py
     

### Summary
This setup allows you to transport the code easily. You can share the `cas_retriever.py` and `requirements.txt` files, and anyone can run the application by following the instructions to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.
